					<img class="galImg" src="Images/TonyToonsLogo.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This logo was designed and used by Anthony Jastrow for his Instagram page while he was doing weekly videos drawing original cartoons. You can check out his works here; </br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/anthonyjastrow/" target="_blank" style="color:white">Instagram.com/AnthonyJastrow</a></p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/KennyLogo.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This logo was was created as a student project revising an existing logo. The idea was to convey the purpose of the company with their logo mark subtly hinting toward piping.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/MotherLogo.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This logo was designed to demonstrate an understanding of the Gestalt principles similarity and proximity. The similar letter forms are grouped closely together creating one unified shape which is recognizable as a baby carriage.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/EnergyLogo.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This logo was designed to demonstrate an understanding of the Gestalt principles figure/ground and closure. The shape of the yellow circle and black lightening bolt are created entirley in your mind through fragmented yellow lines. .</p></br></br></br></br></br></br>

				<div id="posters">
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/JohnWickPoster.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This poster was designed to express the general idea and feeling of the movie as minimally as possible. The gritty texture and subtle gun shape in his right hand elude to the violence in the film, while the empty dog leash hints at the character's motivation.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/WizardLionPoster.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This first of a three part poster series created as if advertising The Wizard of Oz to an unfamiliar audience. The framed painting of the brave and heroic Lion is both an ironic contradiction to the characters behavior during the majority of the film and a simoultanious nod to the development of his character arc as he finds his courage throughout the story.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/WizardTinManPoster.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This second in this three part series, this poster depicts a portrait of a loving Tinman with a big heart. This poster shows the Tinman at his proudest, serving as a milirary doctor with his "heart of goodwill" plainly displayed beside him.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/WizardScarecrowPoster.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This third and final in the Wizard of Oz series portrays the Scarecrow as a brilliant proffesor of thinkology, being recognized for his brilliance. To anyone unfamiliar with the story these contradicing ideas would likely be intruiging then once the film has been seen would make much more sense.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/ParadiseAdPoster.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This poster ad for a fictional brand of scotch was designed entirely with Adobe Illustrator. The sunset, glass, and ice cubes were all created in vector form and are fully rescalable to any size.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/TicTacPoster.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This poster ad for Tic Tacs was created with Modo 3d design software as well as a small portion of photoshop. The produc itself with each individual tic tac inside are all 3d rendered and can easily be moved around and viewed from any angle needed.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/StrangeMusicPoster.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This poster was designed to advertise a fictional music festival, the firey imagery and barbed wire add a level of excitement and edginess to the design. The artists performing at the festival are listed in a circle drawing attention to the music label's logo in it's center.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/VForVendettaPoster.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This movie poster focuses on V, the main character of the film. The "v" shaped fireworks exploding behind him help to draw focus to the main figure and also ellude to the explosions and violence in the film. The crowd wearing identical masks plays to the character's goal throughout the film, uniting people together to stand against government corruption.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/VForVendettaMag1.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This magazine article layout was designed to demonstrate my ability to layout text and images in an interesting and engaging way. The bloody mask elludes to the violence and death in the film and the main character (played by Natalie Portman) is shown within the shadow of the antihero V. The author of the graphic novel is shown in the corner with an insert about the film's origin.</p>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/VForVendettaMag2.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This continuation of the same article includes the iconic blade used by V in the film and on the right side his crowd of followers. Prominantly displayed bove their heads is the grafiti seen sprayed on the walls around the city in the film, glorifying the people's villainous hero.</p></br></br></br></br></br></br>

				<div id="albumArt">
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/MattBegley3.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This is the first of three designs created for singles released by the counrty music artist Matt Begley. Each depicts a silhuette of a country scene. This Sunset nods to the title of the song with a "waving" windmill as well as trees that almost look to be waving in the breeze.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/MattBegley1.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This second single speaks of signing contracts on the "dotted line." The dotted line around the title plays to the nature of the song. The bright sunrise shining draws your eye to the tractor and road subtely suggesting a dotted line on a road.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/MattBegley2.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This third in the series switches to a night scene tying to a night out at a local bar. The glow of the sign is reminiscent of a glowing neon sign one might find in a bar.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/SoftCarnage0.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This album cover is for a fictional band called Soft Carnage. The idea is similar to the band Gorillaz who have cartoon characters that represent the band members, however I imagine this group's music would be much more hardcore and edgy. The blood splatter and somewhat demonic characters imply the dark edgy vibe of the music but the cartoony and playful style makes it more inviting and fun.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/SoftCarnage1.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This design is for same album shown above, this image would be used as an insert for a cd case with the back and side panels included.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/SoftCarnage2.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This is the inside of the same cd case above, a short paragraph about the band on the left and a creative cd design with the album name on the right.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/SoulBox1.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This album design was created as a part of a marketing package for a fictional album release. The colorless rough look and empty space in the imagery emphasises the title of the album. </p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/SoulBox2.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This is the inside panel and cd art for the same project above.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/SoulBox3.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This is the song list on the back and the side panel of the cd case.</p></br>
					<img class="galImg" src="Images/SoulBox4.jpg"></br>
					<p class="artDescription">This is a poster advertising the tour dates and locations as part of the same project above. A teaser video created as part of this project can be found under the "videos" tab at the top of the page.</p></br></br></br></br></br></br>
